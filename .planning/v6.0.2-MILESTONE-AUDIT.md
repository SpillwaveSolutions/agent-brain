# v6.0.2 Milestone Audit

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** passed
**Milestone:** v6.0.2 Plugin & Install Fixes
**Scope:** Phase 11 (1 phase, 1 plan)

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|-------|--------|----------|
| PLUG-07 | Phase 11 | Done | Port auto-discovery (5432-5442) in plugin commands |
| PLUG-08 | Phase 11 | Done | Plugin version 6.0.3 in plugin.json |
| INFRA-06 | Phase 11 | Done | install.sh uses agent-brain path |

**Coverage:** 3/3 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Plans | Summaries | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 11 | 1 | 1 | Complete |

## Cross-Phase Integration

Not applicable — single-phase milestone. Phase 11 depends on Phase 10 (v6.0 completed) which was already shipped.

## E2E Flows

Phase 11 is documentation-only. No new code paths introduced. Existing E2E validation from v6.0 (Phase 10) remains valid.

## Verification Results

Phase 11 verification: PASSED (5/5 must-haves)
- Documentation paths cleaned (17 stale references fixed)
- ROADMAP.md success criteria reflect v6.0.3
- Requirements marked done in REQUIREMENTS.md
- Quality gate passed (772 tests, 0 failures)

## Gaps

None found. All requirements satisfied, all plans complete.

## Assessment

**Status: passed** — v6.0.2 milestone is ready to ship.

This is a small documentation-cleanup milestone. All three requirements were already implemented in code (verified during Phase 10/v6.0); Phase 11 formalized the documentation updates and requirement closure.
